# Gatsby-Next-Firebase_Landing-Template
 React Next Landing Page, built with React, &amp; Google Firebase. NO jQuery! The landing page is a static site that can be built by using either NextJS or Gatsby (My personal favorite). This template has a modern mono repo architecture.  so you can build multiple apps with common components. You can use these landing for your react app. Itâ€™s super easy to deploy, we have provided complete firebase integration with it. You can host your next app into firebase along with other hosts like Netlify, Amazon S3, Amazon Lambda (serverless), Heroku, Github pages, now.sh, etc.
